/**
 * Class Channel provides a channel for sending and receiving messages in the

 * <P>
 * A channel object is not constructed directly. Rather, a channel group object
 * is used to connect a channel to another computer, accept a channel connection
 * from another computer, or obtain a "loopback" channel within the same
 * computer. See class {@linkplain ChannelGroup} for further information.
 * <P>
 * An information object may be associated with a channel. An application using
 * MP can use the information object to hold additional data about the channel.

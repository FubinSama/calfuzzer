/**
 * Class Buf is the abstract base class for a buffer of items sent or received
 * using the Message Protocol (MP).
 * <P>
 * A buffer may be used to send one or more messages at the same time in
 * multiple threads. If a buffer is being used to send a message or messages,
 * the buffer must not be used to receive a message at the same time.
 * <P>
 * A buffer may be used to receive one message at a time. If a buffer is being
 * used to receive a message, the buffer must not be used to receive another
 * message in a different thread, and the buffer must not be used to send a
 * message or messages.
 * <P>
 * A buffer is a conduit for retrieving and storing data in some underlying data
 * structure. If the underlying data structure is multiple thread safe, then one
 * thread can be retrieving or storing data via the buffer at the same time as
 * other threads are accessing the data structure. If the underlying data
 * structure is not multiple thread safe, then other threads must not access the
 * data structure while one thread is retrieving or storing data via the buffer.

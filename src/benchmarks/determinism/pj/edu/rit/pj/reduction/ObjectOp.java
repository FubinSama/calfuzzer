/**
 * Class ObjectOp is the abstract base class for a binary operation on object
 * values, used to do reduction in a parallel program.
 * <P>
 * When classes in the Parallel Java Library call the <TT>op(x,y)</TT> method
 * during a reduction operation, the <TT>x</TT> argument is the value of the
 * reduction variable, and the <TT>y</TT> argument is the value to be combined
 * with the reduction variable. The value returned by the <TT>op(x,y)</TT>
 * method is stored back into the reduction variable.
 * <P>
 * The <TT>op(x,y)</TT> method in any subclass of class ObjectOp must obey the
 * following requirements, which are assumed by classes in the Parallel Java
 * Library:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>
 * If as a result of the binary operation the state of the reduction variable
 * will not change, the <TT>op(x,y)</TT> method must return <TT>x</TT>.
 * <P><LI>
 * If as a result of the binary operation the state of the reduction variable
 * will change, the <TT>op(x,y)</TT> method must return a newly created object
 * containing the desired state.
 * <P><LI>
 * The <TT>op(x,y)</TT> method must neither change the state of <TT>x</TT> nor
 * change the state of <TT>y</TT>; that is, the <TT>op(x,y)</TT> method must
 * have no side effects.
 * </UL>
 *
 * @param  <T>  Object data type.

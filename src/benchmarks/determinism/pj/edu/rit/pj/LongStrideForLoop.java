/**
 * Class LongStrideForLoop is the abstract base class for one variation of a
 * parallel for loop that is executed inside a {@linkplain ParallelRegion}. The
 * loop index data type is <TT>long</TT>. The loop stride is explicitly
 * specified.
 * <P>
 * To execute a parallel for loop, create a {@linkplain ParallelRegion} object;
 * create an instance of a concrete subclass of class LongStrideForLoop; and
 * pass this instance to the parallel region's <TT>execute()</TT> method. Either
 * every parallel team thread must call the parallel region's <TT>execute()</TT>
 * method with identical arguments, or every thread must not call the
 * <TT>execute()</TT> method. You can do all this using an anonymous inner
 * class; for example:
 * <PRE>
 *     new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         . . .
 *         public void run()
 *             {
 *             . . .
 *             execute (0L, 98L, 2L, new LongStrideForLoop()
 *                 {
 *                 // Thread local variable declarations
 *                 . . .
 *                 public void start()
 *                     {
 *                     // Per-thread pre-loop initialization code
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 public void run (long first, long last, long stride)
 *                     {
 *                     // Loop code
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 public void finish()
 *                     {
 *                     // Per-thread post-loop finalization code
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 });
 *             }
 *         . . .
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * The parallel region's <TT>execute()</TT> method does the following. Each
 * parallel team thread calls the parallel for loop's <TT>start()</TT> method
 * once before beginning any loop iterations. The range of loop indexes is
 * divided into "chunks" and the chunks are apportioned among the threads, in a
 * manner determined by the parallel for loop's schedule as returned by the
 * <TT>schedule()</TT> method. Each thread repeatedly calls the parallel for
 * loop's <TT>run()</TT> method, passing in a different chunk on each call,
 * until all the chunks assigned to that thread have been performed. When a
 * thread has finished calling <TT>run()</TT>, the thread calls the parallel for
 * loop's <TT>finish()</TT> method. Then the thread waits at a barrier. When all
 * the threads have reached the barrier, the <TT>execute()</TT> method returns.
 * <P>
 * Note that each parallel team thread actually creates its own instance of the
 * parallel for loop class and passes that instance to the parallel region's
 * <TT>execute()</TT> method. Thus, any fields declared in the parallel for loop
 * class will <I>not</I> be shared by all the threads, but instead will be
 * private to each thread.
 * <P>
 * The <TT>start()</TT> method is intended for performing per-thread
 * initialization before starting the loop iterations. If no such initialization
 * is needed, omit the <TT>start()</TT> method.
 * <P>
 * The <TT>run()</TT> method contains the code for the loop. The first and last
 * indexes for a chunk of loop iterations are passed in as arguments. The loop
 * stride, which is always positive, is also explicitly specified as an
 * argument. The parallel for loop's <TT>run()</TT> method must be coded this
 * way:
 * <PRE>
 *     public void run (long first, long last, long stride)
 *         {
 *         for (long i = first; i &lt;= last; i += stride)
 *             {
 *             // Loop body code
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * with the loop indexes running from <TT>first</TT> to <TT>last</TT> inclusive
 * and increasing by <TT>stride</TT> on each iteration.
 * <P>
 * The <TT>finish()</TT> method is intended for performing per-thread
 * finalization after finishing the loop iterations. If no such finalization is
 * needed, omit the <TT>finish()</TT> method.
 * <P>
 * Sometimes a portion of a parallel for loop has to be executed sequentially in
 * the order of the loop indexes, while the rest of the parallel for loop can be
 * executed concurrently. For example, the loop body is performing some
 * computation that can be executed in parallel for different loop indexes, but
 * the results of each computation must be written to a file sequentially in the
 * order of the loop indexes. The <TT>ordered()</TT> method is provided for this
 * purpose. A call to the <TT>ordered()</TT> method may appear once in the
 * parallel for loop's <TT>run()</TT> method, like so:
 * <PRE>
 *     public void run (long first, long last, long stride)
 *         {
 *         for (long i = first; i &lt;= last; i += stride)
 *             {
 *             // This portion executed concurrently
 *             . . .
 *             ordered (new ParallelSection()
 *                 {
 *                 public void run()
 *                     {
 *                     // This portion executed sequentially
 *                     // in the order of the loop indexes
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 });
 *             // This portion executed concurrently again
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * When called, the <TT>ordered()</TT> method waits until the <TT>ordered()</TT>
 * method has been called and has returned in all loop iterations prior to the
 * current loop iteration. Then the <TT>ordered()</TT> method calls the given
 * parallel section's <TT>run()</TT> method. When the parallel section's
 * <TT>run()</TT> method returns, the <TT>ordered()</TT> method returns. If the
 * parallel section's <TT>run()</TT> method throws an exception, the
 * <TT>ordered()</TT> method throws that same exception.
 * <P>
 * It is possible to stop a parallel for loop using the <TT>stopLoop()</TT>
 * method, like this:
 * <PRE>
 *     public void run (long first, long last, long stride)
 *         {
 *         for (long i = first; i &lt;= last; i += stride)
 *             {
 *             // Loop body
 *             . . .
 *             if (/&#42;time to stop the loop&#42;/)
 *                 {
 *                 stopLoop();
 *                 break;
 *                 }
 *             // More loop body
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * Once <TT>stopLoop()</TT> is called, after each parallel team thread finishes
 * executing its current chunk of iterations, each thread will execute no
 * further chunks and will proceed to finish the parallel for loop. Note well
 * that stopping a parallel for loop is not the same as executing a
 * <TT>break</TT> statement in a regular for loop. The parallel for loop does
 * not stop until each thread, <I>including the thread that called
 * <TT>stopLoop()</TT></I>, has finished its current <I>chunk</I> of iterations.
 * Thus, depending on the parallel for loop's schedule, additional iterations
 * may be executed after <TT>stopLoop()</TT> is called. (The <TT>break</TT>
 * statement in the above example causes the thread that called
 * <TT>stopLoop()</TT> to finish its chunk of iterations early.)
 * <P>
 * Normally, at the end of the parallel for loop, the parallel team threads
 * wait for each other at a barrier. To eliminate this barrier wait, include
 * {@link BarrierAction#NO_WAIT BarrierAction.NO_WAIT} in the <TT>execute()</TT>
 * method call:
 * <PRE>
 *     new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         . . .
 *         public void run()
 *             {
 *             . . .
 *             execute (0L, 98L, 2L, new LongStrideForLoop()
 *                 {
 *                 . . .
 *                 },
 *             BarrierAction.NO_WAIT);
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * To execute a section of code in a single thread as part of the barrier
 * synchronization, include an instance of class {@linkplain BarrierAction} in
 * the <TT>execute()</TT> method call. The barrier action object's
 * <TT>run()</TT> method contains the code to be executed in a single thread
 * while the other threads wait:
 * <PRE>
 *     new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         . . .
 *         public void run()
 *             {
 *             . . .
 *             execute (0L, 98L, 2L, new LongStrideForLoop()
 *                 {
 *                 . . .
 *                 },
 *             new BarrierAction()
 *                 {
 *                 public void run()
 *                     {
 *                     // Single-threaded code goes here
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 });
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * For further information, see class {@linkplain BarrierAction}.
 * <P>
 * If the parallel for loop's <TT>start()</TT>, <TT>run()</TT>, or
 * <TT>finish()</TT> method throws an exception in one of the threads, then that
 * thread executes no further code in the loop, and the parallel region's
 * <TT>execute()</TT> method throws that same exception in that thread.
 * Furthermore, the other threads in the parallel team also execute no further
 * code in the loop after finishing their current chunks. Thus, if one thread
 * throws an exception, the whole parallel for loop exits with some (perhaps
 * none) of the iterations unperformed.

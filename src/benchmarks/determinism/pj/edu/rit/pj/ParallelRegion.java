/**
 * Class ParallelRegion is the abstract base class for a parallel region that is
 * executed by a {@linkplain ParallelTeam} of threads.
 * <P>
 * To execute a parallel region, create a {@linkplain ParallelTeam} object;
 * create an instance of a concrete subclass of class ParallelRegion; and pass
 * this instance to the parallel team's <TT>execute()</TT> method. You can do
 * all this using an anonymous inner class; for example:
 * <PRE>
 *     new ParallelTeam().execute (new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         // Shared variable declarations
 *         . . .
 *         public void start()
 *             {
 *             // Initialization code
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         public void run()
 *             {
 *             // Thread private variable declarations
 *             // Parallel code
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         public void finish()
 *             {
 *             // Finalization code
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         });
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * The parallel team's <TT>execute()</TT> method does the following. The
 * parallel team has a certain number of threads <I>K</I>, where <I>K</I> was
 * specified when the parallel team was constructed. The main thread is the
 * thread calling the parallel team's <TT>execute()</TT> method. The main thread
 * calls the parallel region's <TT>start()</TT> method. When the
 * <TT>start()</TT> method returns, all the team threads call the parallel
 * region's <TT>run()</TT> method concurrently. When all the team threads have
 * returned from the <TT>run()</TT> method, the main thread calls the parallel
 * region's <TT>finish()</TT> method. When the <TT>finish()</TT> method returns,
 * the main thread returns from the parallel team's <TT>execute()</TT> method.
 * <P>
 * Variables to be shared by all threads in the team may be declared as fields
 * of the ParallelRegion subclass. The <TT>start()</TT> method is intended for
 * performing initialization in a single thread before parallel execution
 * begins. If no such initialization is needed, omit the <TT>start()</TT>
 * method. The <TT>run()</TT> method contains code to be executed in parallel by
 * all threads in the team. Variables that are private to each thread may be
 * declared inside the <TT>run()</TT> method. The <TT>finish()</TT> method is
 * intended for performing finalization in a single thread after parallel
 * execution ends. If no such finalization is needed, omit the <TT>finish()</TT>
 * method.
 * <P>
 * If the parallel region's <TT>start()</TT> method throws an exception, the
 * parallel team's <TT>execute()</TT> method throws that same exception, and the
 * <TT>run()</TT> method is not called.
 * <P>
 * If the parallel region's <TT>run()</TT> method throws an exception in one of
 * the team threads, the exception's stack trace is printed on the standard
 * error, the parallel team waits until all the other team threads have returned
 * from the <TT>run()</TT> method, then the parallel team's <TT>execute()</TT>
 * method throws that same exception, and the parallel region's
 * <TT>finish()</TT> method is not called. If the parallel region's
 * <TT>run()</TT> method throws an exception in more than one of the team
 * threads, each exception's stack trace is printed on the standard error, the
 * parallel team waits until all the other team threads have returned from the
 * <TT>run()</TT> method, then the parallel team's <TT>execute()</TT> method
 * throws a {@linkplain MultipleParallelException} wrapping all the thrown
 * exceptions, and the parallel region's <TT>finish()</TT> method is not called.
 * <P>
 * If the parallel region's <TT>finish()</TT> method throws an exception, the
 * parallel team's <TT>execute()</TT> method throws that same exception.

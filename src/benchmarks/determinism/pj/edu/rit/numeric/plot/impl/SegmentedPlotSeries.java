/**
 * Class SegmentedPlotSeries provides a plot series for an {@linkplain XYPlot}.
 * An {@linkplain benchmarks.determinism.pj.edu.ritnumeric.XYSeries XYSeries} specifies the data points
 * to be plotted. The data points are divided into pairs. Each pair of data
 * points specifies the starting and ending coordinates of a line segment. A dot
 * is drawn at each endpoint of each line segment. A line segment's starting
 * coordinates need not be the same as the previous line segment's ending
 * coordinates. If the data series has an odd number of data points, the last
 * data point is ignored.
 * <P>
 * Class SegmentedPlotSeries provides operations to tell where to plot data
 * points as well as which {@linkplain benchmarks.determinism.pj.edu.ritswing.Drawable Drawable} object
 * to use to plot the points. Class {@linkplain benchmarks.determinism.pj.edu.ritnumeric.plot.Dots Dots}
 * provides several shapes of drawable objects for plotting data points.
 * <P>
 * Class SegmentedPlotSeries provides operations to tell where to plot line
 * segments as well as which stroke and color objects to use to plot the line
 * segments. Class {@linkplain benchmarks.determinism.pj.edu.ritnumeric.plot.Strokes Strokes} provides
 * several kinds of strokes for drawing lines.

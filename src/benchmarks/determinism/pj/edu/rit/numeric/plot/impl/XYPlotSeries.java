/**
 * Class XYPlotSeries provides a plot series for an {@linkplain XYPlot}. An
 * {@linkplain benchmarks.determinism.pj.edu.ritnumeric.XYSeries XYSeries} specifies the data points to
 * be plotted. A dot is drawn at each data point in the series. A line segment
 * is drawn from each data point to the next data point in the series.
 * <P>
 * Class XYPlotSeries provides operations to tell where to plot data points as
 * well as which {@linkplain benchmarks.determinism.pj.edu.ritswing.Drawable Drawable} object to use to
 * plot the points. Class {@linkplain benchmarks.determinism.pj.edu.ritnumeric.plot.Dots Dots} provides
 * several shapes of drawable objects for plotting data points.
 * <P>
 * Class XYPlotSeries provides operations to tell where to plot line segments as
 * well as which stroke and color objects to use to plot the line segments.
 * Class {@linkplain benchmarks.determinism.pj.edu.ritnumeric.plot.Strokes Strokes} provides several
 * kinds of strokes for drawing lines.

/**
 * Class MaximumParsimonyBnbSmp provides an SMP parallel algorithm for maximum
 * parsimony phylogenetic tree construction using branch-and-bound search.
 * <P>
 * Class MaximumParsimonyBnbSmp is designed to be used in an SMP parallel
 * program that runs in one process with multiple threads. Each thread has its
 * own MaximumParsimonyBnbSmp instance. Each thread uses its own
 * MaximumParsimonyBnbSmp instance to search different sections of the search
 * graph concurrently.
 * <P>
 * The process has a shared variable, <I>bound</I>, that holds the best
 * parsimony score found so far (i.e., the bound for branch-and-bound search).
 * The <I>bound</I> variable is an instance of class {@linkplain
 * benchmarks.determinism.pj.edu.ritpj.reduction.SharedInteger}. All the MaximumParsimonyBnbSmp instances
 * within the process share the same <I>bound</I> variable. Whenever one thread
 * finds a phylogenetic tree with a better parsimony score, it notifies all the
 * threads by updating the <I>bound</I> variable.
 * <P>
 * To perform a search, the process must:
 * <OL TYPE=1>
 * <LI>
 * Call the static <TT>createBoundVariable()</TT> method to create the shared
 * <I>bound</I> variable.
 * </OL>
 * Then each thread in the process must:
 * <OL TYPE=1 START=2>
 * <LI>
 * Create its own instance of class MaximumParsimonyBnbSmp, passing in a
 * {@linkplain DnaSequenceList} of the DNA sequences in the tree, a reference to
 * the process's shared <I>bound</I> variable, and a {@linkplain
 * MaximumParsimonyResults} object to hold the search results.
 * <P><LI>
 * Call the <TT>findTrees()</TT> method one or more times, each time indicating
 * a section of the search graph to search. The results of searching that
 * section are accumulated into the {@linkplain MaximumParsimonyResults} object
 * specified to the constructor.
 * </OL>
 * <P>
 * <I>Note:</I> Class MaximumParsimonyBnbSmp is not multiple thread safe; it is
 * intended to be used as a per-thread variable.

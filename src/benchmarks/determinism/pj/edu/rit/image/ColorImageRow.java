/**
 * Class ColorImageRow provides one row of a color image. The image row is
 * layered on top of an integer array (type <TT>int[]</TT>). Use the
 * <TT>setArray()</TT> method to specify which array this is. The width of the
 * image row is equal to the number of elements in the underlying array. The
 * image row's underlying array usually is (but does not have to be) one row of
 * an image's underlying matrix.
 * <P>
 * To read and write the pixels of an image row, use the <TT>getPixel()</TT>,
 * <TT>getPixelColor()</TT>, <TT>setPixel()</TT>, <TT>setPixelColor()</TT>, and
 * <TT>setPixelHSB()</TT> methods.
 * <P>
 * Changing the contents of the underlying array directly will also change the
 * image. The color information is stored in an array element as follows:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Bits 31 .. 24 -- Unused, must be 0
 * <LI>Bits 23 .. 16 -- Red component in the range 0 .. 255
 * <LI>Bits 15 .. 8 -- Green component in the range 0 .. 255
 * <LI>Bits 7 .. 0 -- Blue component in the range 0 .. 255
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * <B>HSB Colors.</B> A color may be specified using hue, saturation, and
 * brightness components instead of red, green, and blue components.
 * <P>
 * The hue component gives the basic color. A hue of 0 = red; 1/6 = yellow; 2/6
 * = green; 3/6 = cyan; 4/6 = blue; 5/6 = magenta; 1 = red again. Intermediate
 * hue values yield intermediate colors.
 * <P>
 * The saturation component specifies how gray or colored the color is. A
 * saturation of 0 yields fully gray; a saturation of 1 yields fully colored.
 * Intermediate saturation values yield mixtures of gray and colored.
 * <P>
 * The brightness component specifies how dark or light the color is. A
 * brightness of 0 yields fully dark (black); a brightness of 1 yields fully
 * light (somewhere between white and colored depending on the saturation).
 * Intermediate brightness values yield somewhere between a gray shade and a
 * darkened color (depending on the saturation).

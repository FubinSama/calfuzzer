/**
 * Interface TimerTask specifies the interface for an object that performs timed
 * actions under the control of a {@linkplain Timer}.
 * <P>
 * When a timer is created, it is associated with a timer task. When the timer
 * becomes triggered -- that is, when the time comes to do the timed actions --
 * the timer calls the timer task's <TT>action()</TT> method. The timer passes a
 * reference to itself as an argument to the timer task's <TT>action()</TT>
 * method.
 * <P>
 * The first thing the timer task must do in the <TT>action()</TT> method is
 * check whether the timer is still triggered. If it is, the <TT>action()</TT>
 * method can perform its processing. But if the timer is no longer triggered,
 * the <TT>action()</TT> method must return without doing anything.
 * <P>
 * This is to deal with a race condition that can arise when multiple threads
 * are involved. Suppose the timer thread triggers the timer, the timer calls
 * the timer task's <TT>action()</TT> method, and the <TT>action()</TT> method
 * synchronizes on the object that will perform the action. Suppose the
 * <TT>action()</TT> method blocks because some other thread is already
 * executing a synchronized method on this object. Suppose the other thread
 * cancels the timer. Here is the race condition: the timer was canceled just as
 * it was triggered but before it could do the timed actions. When the other
 * thread returns, the <TT>action()</TT> method unblocks and proceeds to
 * execute. The <TT>action()</TT> method must check whether the timer got
 * canceled between the time when the <TT>action()</TT> method was called and
 * the time when the <TT>action()</TT> method started executing. If the
 * <TT>action()</TT> method doesn't do this check, it may erroneously perform
 * the timeout actions despite the timer cancellation.
 * <P>
 * Classes {@linkplain Timer}, TimerTask, and {@linkplain TimerThread} provide
 * capabilities similar to classes java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask.
 * Unlike the latter, they also provide the ability to stop and restart a timer
 * and the ability to deal with race conditions in multithreaded programs.

/**
 * An unbounded priority {@linkplain Queue queue} based on a priority
 * heap.  This queue orders elements according to an order specified
 * at construction time, which is specified either according to their
 * <i>natural order</i> (see {@link Comparable}), or according to a
 * {@link benchmarks.instrumented.java15.util.Comparator}, depending on which constructor is
 * used. A priority queue does not permit <tt>null</tt> elements.
 * A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not
 * permit insertion of non-comparable objects (doing so may result
 * in <tt>ClassCastException</tt>). 
 *
 * <p>The <em>head</em> of this queue is the <em>least</em> element
 * with respect to the specified ordering.  If multiple elements are
 * tied for least value, the head is one of those elements -- ties are
 * broken arbitrarily.  The queue retrieval operations <tt>poll</tt>,
 * <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>peek</tt>, and <tt>element</tt> access the
 * element at the head of the queue.
 *
 * <p>A priority queue is unbounded, but has an internal
 * <i>capacity</i> governing the size of an array used to store the
 * elements on the queue.  It is always at least as large as the queue
 * size.  As elements are added to a priority queue, its capacity
 * grows automatically.  The details of the growth policy are not
 * specified.
 *
 * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
 * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link
 * Iterator} interfaces. 
 * The
 * Iterator provided in method {@link #iterator()} is <em>not</em>
 * guaranteed to traverse the elements of the PriorityQueue in any
 * particular order. If you need ordered traversal, consider using
 * <tt>Arrays.sort(pq.toArray())</tt>.
 *
 * <p> <strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * Multiple threads should not access a <tt>PriorityQueue</tt>
 * instance concurrently if any of the threads modifies the list
 * structurally. Instead, use the thread-safe {@link
 * benchmarks.instrumented.java15.util.concurrent.PriorityBlockingQueue} class.
 *
 * 
 * <p>Implementation note: this implementation provides O(log(n)) time
 * for the insertion methods (<tt>offer</tt>, <tt>poll</tt>,
 * <tt>remove()</tt> and <tt>add</tt>) methods; linear time for the
 * <tt>remove(Object)</tt> and <tt>contains(Object)</tt> methods; and
 * constant time for the retrieval methods (<tt>peek</tt>,
 * <tt>element</tt>, and <tt>size</tt>).
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../guide/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.

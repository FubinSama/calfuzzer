/**
 * Class CommRequest provides an object for doing a non-blocking message passing
 * operation in a PJ cluster parallel program. A non-blocking message passing
 * operation in class {@linkplain Comm} immediately returns a CommRequest object
 * while performing the message passing operation in a separate thread. This
 * allows the calling thread to do other work while the message passing
 * operation is in progress. When the calling thread needs to wait for the
 * message passing operation to finish, the calling thread calls the CommRequest
 * object's <TT>waitForFinish()</TT> method.

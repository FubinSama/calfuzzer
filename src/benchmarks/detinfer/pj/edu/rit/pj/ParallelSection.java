/**
 * Class ParallelSection is the abstract base class for a section of code to be
 * executed in parallel.
 * <P>
 * A group of parallel sections may be executed concurrently by calling a
 * {@linkplain ParallelRegion}'s <TT>execute()</TT> method. Each section in the
 * group is executed by a different thread in the parallel thread team. Here is
 * one way to code a parallel section group with two parallel sections:
 * <PRE>
 *     new ParallelTeam(2).execute (new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         public void run() throws Exception
 *             {
 *             execute
 *                 (new ParallelSection()
 *                     {
 *                     public void run()
 *                         {
 *                         // Code for first concurrent parallel section
 *                         . . .
 *                         }
 *                     },
 *                  new ParallelSection()
 *                     {
 *                     public void run()
 *                         {
 *                         // Code for second concurrent parallel section
 *                         . . .
 *                         }
 *                     });
 *             }
 *         });
 * </PRE>
 * Here is another way to code a parallel section group with two parallel
 * sections:
 * <PRE>
 *     ParallelSection section_1 = new ParallelSection()
 *         {
 *         public void run()
 *             {
 *             // Code for first concurrent parallel section
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         };
 *     ParallelSection section_2 = new ParallelSection()
 *         {
 *         public void run()
 *             {
 *             // Code for second concurrent parallel section
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         };
 *     new ParallelTeam(2).execute (new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         public void run() throws Exception
 *             {
 *             execute (section_1, section_2);
 *             }
 *         });
 * </PRE>
 * A parallel section group may contain any number of parallel sections. There
 * are overloaded <TT>execute()</TT> methods that take one, two, or three
 * parallel section arguments. If there are four or more parallel sections, put
 * them in an array (type <TT>ParallelSection[]</TT>) and pass the array to the
 * <TT>execute()</TT> method.
 * <P>
 * Normally, at the end of the parallel section group, the parallel team threads
 * wait for each other at a barrier. To eliminate this barrier wait, include
 * {@link BarrierAction#NO_WAIT BarrierAction.NO_WAIT} in the <TT>execute()</TT>
 * method call:
 * <PRE>
 *     new ParallelTeam(2).execute (new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         public void run() throws Exception
 *             {
 *             execute (section_1, section_2, BarrierAction.NO_WAIT);
 *             }
 *         });
 * </PRE>
 * To execute a section of code in a single thread as part of the barrier
 * synchronization, include an instance of class {@linkplain BarrierAction} in
 * the <TT>execute()</TT> method call. The barrier action object's
 * <TT>run()</TT> method contains the code to be executed in a single thread
 * while the other threads wait:
 * <PRE>
 *     new ParallelTeam(2).execute (new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         public void run() throws Exception
 *             {
 *             execute (section_1, section_2, new BarrierAction()
 *                 {
 *                 public void run()
 *                     {
 *                     // Single-threaded code goes here
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 });
 *             }
 *         });
 * </PRE>
 * For further information, see class {@linkplain BarrierAction}.
 * <P>
 * A parallel section may be executed by one thread in the parallel thread team
 * by executing a parallel section group consisting of the one parallel section,
 * as shown above:
 * <PRE>
 *     new ParallelTeam().execute (new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         public void run() throws Exception
 *             {
 *             . . .
 *             execute (new ParallelSection()
 *                 {
 *                 public void run()
 *                     {
 *                     // Code to be executed by one parallel team thread
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 });
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         });
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * A parallel section may be executed in a mutually exclusive fashion by calling
 * a {@linkplain ParallelRegion}'s <TT>critical()</TT> or
 * <TT>criticalNonexclusive()</TT> method. For example:
 * <PRE>
 *     new ParallelTeam().execute (new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         public void run() throws Exception
 *             {
 *             . . .
 *             critical (new ParallelSection()
 *                 {
 *                 public void run()
 *                     {
 *                     // Mutually exclusive code
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 });
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         });
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * By calling a {@linkplain ParallelForLoop}'s <TT>ordered()</TT> method, a
 * parallel section may be executed in the order of the loop indexes within a
 * parallel for loop body, while the rest of the parallel for loop body executes
 * concurrently. See classes {@linkplain IntegerForLoop}, {@linkplain
 * IntegerStrideForLoop}, {@linkplain LongForLoop}, and {@linkplain
 * LongStrideForLoop} for further information.
 * <P>
 * By calling a {@linkplain ParallelIteration}'s <TT>ordered()</TT> method, a
 * parallel section may be executed in the order of the items within a parallel
 * iteration body, while the rest of the parallel iteration body executes
 * concurrently. See class {@linkplain ParallelIteration} for further
 * information.

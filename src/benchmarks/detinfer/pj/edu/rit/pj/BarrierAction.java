/**
 * Class BarrierAction is the abstract base class for an object containing code
 * that is executed as part of a barrier wait. A barrier wait occurs in these
 * situations within a {@linkplain ParallelRegion}:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>
 * When the {@linkplain ParallelTeam} threads finish executing all the
 * iterations of a parallel for loop.
 * <P><LI>
 * When the {@linkplain ParallelTeam} threads finish executing all the
 * {@linkplain ParallelSection}s in a group of parallel sections.
 * <P><LI>
 * When the {@linkplain ParallelTeam} threads call the {@linkplain
 * ParallelRegion}'s <TT>barrier()</TT> method explicitly.
 * </UL>
 * As each thread finishes executing one of the above constructs, each thread
 * encounters a barrier. What happens next depends on the barrier action
 * specified for that construct. There are three possibilities:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>
 * If the barrier action is omitted, or if the barrier action is {@link #WAIT
 * BarrierAction.WAIT}, each thread stops and waits at the barrier. When all
 * threads have arrived at the barrier, each thread resumes and proceeds to
 * execute whatever comes after the construct.
 * <P><LI>
 * If the barrier action is {@link #NO_WAIT BarrierAction.NO_WAIT}, nothing
 * happens. The threads do not wait for each other. Each thread immediately
 * proceeds to execute whatever comes after the construct.
 * <P><LI>
 * If the barrier action is an instance of class BarrierAction with the
 * <TT>run()</TT> method overridden, each thread stops and waits at the barrier.
 * When all threads have arrived at the barrier, <I>one</I> thread calls the
 * BarrierAction object's <TT>run()</TT> method. The particular thread that
 * calls the <TT>run()</TT> method is not specified. During this time the other
 * threads remain stopped. When the <TT>run()</TT> method returns, each thread
 * resumes and proceeds to execute whatever comes after the construct.
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * Thus, the barrier serves to synchronize all the threads at the end of a
 * parallel construct and possibly to execute a section of code in a single
 * thread.

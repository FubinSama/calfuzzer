/**
 * Class ParallelIteration is the abstract base class for a parallel iteration
 * that is executed inside a {@linkplain ParallelRegion}. The parallel iteration
 * lets you iterate over a group of items, with a separate parallel team thread
 * processing each item. The generic type parameter T specifies the items' data
 * type. The items can be the elements of an array, the items obtained from an
 * {@linkplain java.util.Iterator Iterator}, or the items contained in an
 * {@linkplain java.lang.Iterable Iterable} collection.
 * <P>
 * To execute a parallel iteration, create a {@linkplain ParallelRegion} object;
 * create an instance of a concrete subclass of class ParallelIteration; and
 * pass this instance to the parallel region's <TT>execute()</TT> method. Either
 * every parallel team thread must call the parallel region's <TT>execute()</TT>
 * method with identical arguments, or every thread must not call the
 * <TT>execute()</TT> method. You can do all this using an anonymous inner
 * class; for example:
 * <PRE>
 *     new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         ArrayList&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
 *         . . .
 *         public void run()
 *             {
 *             . . .
 *             execute (list, new ParallelIteration&lt;String&gt;()
 *                 {
 *                 // Thread local variable declarations
 *                 . . .
 *                 public void start()
 *                     {
 *                     // Per-thread pre-loop initialization code
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 public void run (String item)
 *                     {
 *                     // Loop body code
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 public void finish()
 *                     {
 *                     // Per-thread post-loop finalization code
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 });
 *             }
 *         . . .
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * The parallel region's <TT>execute()</TT> method does the following. One of
 * the parallel team threads sets up the source of the items to be iterated over
 * -- either an array's elements, an iterator's items, or an iterable
 * collection's contents. (Note that only <I>one</I> thread does this setup; but
 * because all threads must call the parallel region's <TT>execute()</TT> method
 * with identical arguments, it doesn't matter which thread does the setup.)
 * Each parallel team thread calls the parallel iteration's <TT>start()</TT>
 * method once before beginning any loop iterations. Each thread repeatedly
 * calls the parallel iteration's <TT>run()</TT> method, passing in a different
 * item on each call, until all the items have been processed. When a thread has
 * finished calling <TT>run()</TT>, the thread calls the parallel iteration's
 * <TT>finish()</TT> method. Then the thread waits at a barrier. When all the
 * threads have reached the barrier, the <TT>execute()</TT> method returns.
 * <P>
 * Note that each parallel team thread actually creates its own instance of the
 * parallel iteration class and passes that instance to the parallel region's
 * <TT>execute()</TT> method. Thus, any fields declared in the parallel
 * iteration class will <I>not</I> be shared by all the threads, but instead
 * will be private to each thread.
 * <P>
 * The <TT>start()</TT> method is intended for performing per-thread
 * initialization before starting the loop iterations. If no such initialization
 * is needed, omit the <TT>start()</TT> method.
 * <P>
 * The <TT>run()</TT> method contains the code for the loop body. It does
 * whatever processing is needed on the one item passed in as an argument. Note
 * that, unlike a parallel for loop (class {@linkplain ParallelForLoop}), a
 * parallel iteration is not "chunked;" each parallel team thread always
 * processes just one item at a time.
 * <P>
 * The <TT>finish()</TT> method is intended for performing per-thread
 * finalization after finishing the loop iterations. If no such finalization is
 * needed, omit the <TT>finish()</TT> method.
 * <P>
 * Sometimes a portion of a parallel iteration has to be executed sequentially
 * in the same order as the items' iteration order, while the rest of the
 * parallel iteration can be executed concurrently. For example, the loop body
 * is performing some computation that can be executed in parallel for different
 * items, but the results of each computation must be written to a file
 * sequentially in the items' iteration order. The <TT>ordered()</TT> method is
 * provided for this purpose. A call to the <TT>ordered()</TT> method may appear
 * once in the parallel iteration's <TT>run()</TT> method, like so:
 * <PRE>
 *     public void run (String item)
 *         {
 *         // This portion executed concurrently
 *         . . .
 *         ordered (new ParallelSection()
 *             {
 *             public void run()
 *                 {
 *                 // This portion executed sequentially
 *                 // in the items' iteration order
 *                 . . .
 *                 }
 *             });
 *         // This portion executed concurrently again
 *         . . .
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * When called, the <TT>ordered()</TT> method waits until the <TT>ordered()</TT>
 * method has been called and has returned for all items prior to the current
 * item. Then the <TT>ordered()</TT> method calls the given parallel section's
 * <TT>run()</TT> method. When the parallel section's <TT>run()</TT> method
 * returns, the <TT>ordered()</TT> method returns. If the parallel section's
 * <TT>run()</TT> method throws an exception, the <TT>ordered()</TT> method
 * throws that same exception.
 * <P>
 * It is possible to stop a parallel iteration using the <TT>stopLoop()</TT>
 * method, like this:
 * <PRE>
 *     public void run (String item)
 *         {
 *         // Loop body
 *         . . .
 *         if (/&#42;time to stop the loop&#42;/)
 *             {
 *             stopLoop();
 *             return;
 *             }
 *         // More loop body
 *         . . .
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * Once <TT>stopLoop()</TT> is called, after each parallel team thread finishes
 * processing its current item, each thread will process no further items and
 * will proceed to finish the parallel iteration. Note well that stopping a
 * parallel iteration is not the same as executing a <TT>break</TT> statement in
 * a regular loop. The parallel iteration does not stop until each thread,
 * <I>including the thread that called <TT>stopLoop()</TT></I>, has finished
 * processing its current item. Thus, processing may continue for a while after
 * <TT>stopLoop()</TT> is called. (The <TT>return</TT> statement in the above
 * example causes the thread that called <TT>stopLoop()</TT> to stop its
 * processing early.)
 * <P>
 * Normally, at the end of the parallel iteration, the parallel team threads
 * wait for each other at a barrier. To eliminate this barrier wait, include
 * {@link BarrierAction#NO_WAIT BarrierAction.NO_WAIT} in the <TT>execute()</TT>
 * method call:
 * <PRE>
 *     new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         . . .
 *         public void run()
 *             {
 *             . . .
 *             execute (list, new ParallelIteration&lt;String&gt;()
 *                 {
 *                 . . .
 *                 },
 *             BarrierAction.NO_WAIT);
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * To execute a section of code in a single thread as part of the barrier
 * synchronization, include an instance of class {@linkplain BarrierAction} in
 * the <TT>execute()</TT> method call. The barrier action object's
 * <TT>run()</TT> method contains the code to be executed in a single thread
 * while the other threads wait:
 * <PRE>
 *     new ParallelRegion()
 *         {
 *         . . .
 *         public void run()
 *             {
 *             . . .
 *             execute (list, new ParallelIteration&lt;String&gt;()
 *                 {
 *                 . . .
 *                 },
 *             new BarrierAction()
 *                 {
 *                 public void run()
 *                     {
 *                     // Single-threaded code goes here
 *                     . . .
 *                     }
 *                 });
 *             . . .
 *             }
 *         }
 * </PRE>
 * For further information, see class {@linkplain BarrierAction}.
 * <P>
 * If the parallel iteration's <TT>start()</TT>, <TT>run()</TT>, or
 * <TT>finish()</TT> method throws an exception in one of the threads, then that
 * thread executes no further code in the loop, and the parallel region's
 * <TT>execute()</TT> method throws that same exception in that thread.
 * Furthermore, the other threads in the parallel team also process no further
 * items after finishing their current items. Thus, if one thread throws an
 * exception, the whole parallel iteration exits with some (perhaps none) of the
 * iterations unperformed.
 *
 * @param  <T>  Data type of the items iterated over.

/**
 * Class Alignment encapsulates the result of a sequence alignment between a
 * query sequence and a subject sequence. Alignment objects are returned by the
 * <TT>align()</TT> method of class {@linkplain ProteinLocalAlignment}.
 * <P>
 * An alignment object does not record the actual query sequence and subject
 * sequence that were aligned. The alignment object does record an ID associated
 * with the query sequence and an ID associated with the subject sequence. For
 * example, the ID could be the index of a sequence in a {@linkplain
 * ProteinDatabase}.
 * <P>
 * Class Alignment implements interface Comparable and so has a natural
 * ordering. The comparison order depends on the alignment scores and the
 * subject sequence IDs. An alignment with a higher score comes before an
 * alignment with a lower score. If the scores are equal, an alignment with a
 * lower subject sequence ID comes before an alignment with a higher subject
 * sequence ID.

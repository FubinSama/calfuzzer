/**
 * Class PixelAnalysis provides a routine for doing a spin relaxometry analysis
 * on one pixel of a magnetic resonance image.
 * <P>
 * The input to the analysis is a measured spin signal expressed as two
 * {@linkplain benchmarks.detinfer.pj.edu.ritnumeric.Series Series} objects, a time series
 * <I>t</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and a spin signal series
 * <I>S</I>(<I>t</I><SUB><I>i</I></SUB>). Another input is a series of fixed
 * spin-lattice relaxation rates <I>R</I>1<SUB><I>j</I></SUB>. These rates are
 * chosen to cover the range of likely rates for the magnetic resonance image
 * being analyzed.
 * <P>
 * The routine first does a <I>nonnegative, linear</I> least squares fit of the
 * input data to a model consisting of a group of tissues with the input fixed
 * spin-lattice relaxation rates <I>R</I>1<SUB><I>j</I></SUB>. Peaks in the
 * linear least squares fit determine the number of tissues and the approximate
 * spin density and spin-lattice relaxation rate for each tissue.
 * <P>
 * The routine then does a <I>nonlinear</I> least squares fit of the input data
 * to a model consisting of the number of tissues determined in the previous
 * step. The nonlinear least squares fit "polishes up" the spin densities and
 * spin-lattice relaxation rates determined in the previous step, which are only
 * approximate.
 * <P>
 * The routine checks the nonlinear least squares fit for plausibility. To be
 * plausible:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>
 * All spin densities and spin-lattice relaxation rates must be positive. (If
 * this is not the case, it's likely the nonlinear least squares fit is trying
 * to fit the data to too many parameters, resulting in nonsensical parameter
 * values.)
 * <P><LI>
 * All the spin-lattice relaxation rates must be sufficiently far apart.
 * Specifically, the relative difference between any two rates must be greater
 * than 0.001. (If the rates are closer together than that, it's likely they
 * represent the same tissue.)
 * <P><LI>
 * The sum of the spin densities must agree with the asymptotic spin signal for
 * large values of <I>t</I>. Specifically, the sum must be within 20% of the
 * average of the last seven spin signal values. (If this is not the case, it's
 * likely that two spurious "tissues," one with a very large relaxation rate,
 * one with a very small relaxation rate, are canceling each other out, and
 * there really should be only one tissue.)
 * </UL>
 * If the nonlinear least squares fit is not plausible, the routine decides it
 * is trying to fit too many tissues. The routine eliminates the tissue with the
 * smallest spin density and repeats the nonlinear least squares fit. This
 * continues until the fit is plausible or until all the tissues have been
 * eliminated, in which case the routine reports that it could not find a
 * solution.
 * <P>
 * The output of the analysis is a list of the tissues' computed spin densities
 * and a list of the tissues' computed spin-lattice relaxation rates.

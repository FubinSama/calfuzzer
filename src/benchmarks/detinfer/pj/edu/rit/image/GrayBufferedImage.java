/**
 * Class GrayBufferedImage provides a grayscale image. The image is layered on
 * top of a byte matrix (type <TT>byte[][]</TT>). The height and width of the
 * image are equal to the number of rows and columns in the underlying matrix.
 * The gray information is stored in a matrix element as a number from 0 (black)
 * to 255 (white).
 * <P>
 * The rows and columns of the underlying matrix need not all be allocated. If
 * you get a pixel in an unallocated row or column, a pixel value of 0 (black)
 * is returned. If you set a pixel in an unallocated row or column, the pixel
 * value is discarded.
 * <P>
 * Since class GrayBufferedImage is a subclass of class {@linkplain
 * java.awt.image.BufferedImage}, you can do all the following with a grayscale
 * image just as you would with a BufferedImage: display it on the screen, draw
 * into it using a graphics context, copy another grayscale BufferedImage into
 * it, read it from or write it to a file using package {@linkplain
 * javax.imageio}.

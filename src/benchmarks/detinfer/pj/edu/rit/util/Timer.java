 * <P>
 * When a timer is created, it is associated with a {@linkplain TimerTask}. The
 * timer is initially <B>stopped.</B> The timer can then be <B>started</B> in
 * various ways. The timer will then <B>time out</B> at some instant, depending
 * on how it was started. When the timer times out, the timer becomes
 * <B>triggered,</B> and the timer's timer task's <TT>action()</TT> method is
 * called. The timer task can stop the timer, or it can start the timer again
 * for a different timeout, or it can leave the timer alone. If the timer task
 * does not start or stop the timer, the timer goes into a state determined by
 * the way the timer was originally started. If the timer was started with a
 * <B>periodic timeout,</B> the timer automatically starts itself to time out
 * again after a certain interval. If the timer was started with a <B>one-shot
 * timeout,</B> the timer automatically stops itself.
 * <P>
 * By calling the appropriate method, a timer may be started to do timeouts in
 * any of the following ways:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>
 * <B>One-shot timeout.</B> The timer task's action is performed just once at a
 * certain point in time, specified either as an absolute time or as an interval
 * from now.
 * <BR>&nbsp;
 * <LI>
 * <B>Periodic fixed-rate timeout.</B> The timer task's action is performed
 * repeatedly at a given interval. The first action happens at a certain point
 * in time, specified either as an absolute time or as an interval from now.
 * Thereafter, each subsequent action starts at the given repetition interval
 * after the <I>scheduled start</I> of the previous action. Thus, the interval
 * between the scheduled starts of successive actions is always the same,
 * regardless of how long each action takes to complete, and the interval
 * between successive actions may vary, depending on how long each action takes
 * to complete.
 * <BR>&nbsp;
 * <LI>
 * <B>Periodic fixed-interval timeout.</B> The timer task's action is performed
 * repeatedly at a given interval. The first action happens at a certain point
 * in time, specified either as an absolute time or as an interval from now.
 * Thereafter, each subsequent action starts at the given repetition interval
 * after the <I>end</I> of the previous action. Thus, the interval between the
 * starts of successive actions may vary, depending on how long each action
 * takes to complete, and the interval between successive actions is always the
 * same, regardless of how long each action takes to complete.
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * A Timer object is not constructed directly. Rather, a timer object is created
 * by calling a {@linkplain TimerThread}'s <TT>createTimer()</TT> method, giving
 * a timer task to associate with the timer. A single timer thread can control
 * any number of timers. The timer thread is responsible for doing all the
 * timers' timeouts and causing the timers to call the timer tasks'
 * <TT>action()</TT> methods at the proper times. Since a timer thread does not
 * provide real-time guarantees, the time at which a timer task's action
 * actually starts may be later than when the timeout occurred.
 * <P>
 * Classes Timer, {@linkplain TimerTask}, and {@linkplain TimerThread} provide
 * capabilities similar to classes java.util.Timer and java.util.TimerTask.
 * Unlike the latter, they also provide the ability to stop and restart a timer
 * and the ability to deal with race conditions in multithreaded programs.

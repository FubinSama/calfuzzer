/**
 * Class BlockCipher is the abstract base class for a block cipher. A block
 * cipher object can encrypt a block of plaintext, yielding a block of
 * ciphertext. (Decryption is defined in another class.) The encryption key is
 * specified when the block cipher object is constructed and may also be
 * specified by calling the <TT>setKey()</TT> method. A block cipher object can
 * report the number of bytes in the block (the block length) and the number of
 * bytes in the key (the key length).
 * <P>
 * The actual encryption algorithm is implemented in a subclass.

HOW CAN I WRITE MY OWN ANALYSIS?
--------------------------
Check out the tool paper activetool.pdf.

See

src/javato/activetesting/HybridAnalysis.java
src/javato/activetesting/RaceFuzzerAnalysis.java

for an implementation of RaceFuzzer.  Note that this is not the optimized implementation reported in the PLDI'08 paper.

see the target "racefuzzer" and target "test_sor" in run.xml for details on how to invoke RaceFuzzer

Similarly, see

src/javato/activetesting/IGoodlockAnalysis.java
src/javato/activetesting/DeadlockFuzzerAnalysis.java

for an implementation of DeadlockFuzzer.  Note that this is not the optimized implementation reported in the PLDI'09 paper.

see the target "deadlockfuzzer" and target "test_6" in run.xml for details on how to invoke DeadlockFuzzer

Similarly, see

src/javato/activetesting/PAtomicityAnalysis.java
src/javato/activetesting/RaceFuzzerAnalysis.java

for an implementation of AtomFuzzer.  Note that this is not the implementation reported in the FSE'09 paper, but
a combination of the techniques reported in FSE 09 and CAV 09.

see the target "atomfuzzer" and target "test_atomfuzzer15" in run.xml for details on how to invoke AtomFuzzer
